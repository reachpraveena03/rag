            "|When it comes to revenue, again it is most helpful and proactive if everyone from your Global Director to country leads, to managers to RPs or PPs are having these kinds of conversations with managers or business leads. As a good rule of thumb, if you are forecasting any significant starts or ends, you need to forecast a matching increase or decrease in SG&A.|Other ways to manage your BLC- is to evaluate WHY you have the number of PMO members that you do. For example, are you top heavy with too much Director or Manager time allocated against this client? Or do you have more RPs than a normal program should have. You should evaluate if you are a brand new launched program so it makes sense you might have more PMO members at launch since everything is new. If you are not a new program look at how many manual or additonal processes your team does compared to others. Also look at your MSP fee or rebates. Sometimes older accounts have cut their MSP fees or offered more rebates, which will always cut into your revenue. THe Director should reach out to their MD and other Directors to compare their SG&A hours from finance and TAPFIN TIME. If you have more team members for the same amount of revenue, or if your fees are smaller or rebates are higher, this is a possible root cause fo your BLS issues. Your options include talking to your VP about renegotiating your MSP fee, or rebates. OR you can look at what manual processes you can no longer afford to run for the client.| |Not tracked in TDW - unreportable by BI| | |15| | | | | | |\n",

Remember that the goal of implementing an MSP is to uncover the issues and resolve in the first year. There should not be a feeling that the MSP is at fault for uncovering issues. However what the MSP should convey is expected issues, and how quickly solutions are suggested or implemented. For example you should never present an issue in the QBR without a plan for the mitigation or solution. If you are only presenting the data slides that your BI team is giving you then you are a reactive program. You should be interpreting the results and creating slides for the QBR that show how you have or will be addressing the problem. In addition you should be showing the data to show if your solutions are successful.| | |Intermediate/Advanced:| | | | | | | | | |\n",

This ideally should be done during implementation as the solutions and design are being decided. All PMs should also walk through this with their managers so they can understand where their program falls.

It is very important that you use this for the existing heads you bring in and can track that spend accordingly. Any new future workers that come into the program|You should be thinking of your contingent module as the place for ALL time and expense workers and not just ones that need to compete like the other regular suppliers. For example, if you have a supplier that is not in your program and they and the business do not want them coming into the program in a competrive sourcing situation then you should NOT be presenting that as a solution. The goal is to bring the spend in and NOT to force them to compete. This will allow you to being in a supplier and let them work directly with their hiring managers. They should get their own ditribution list and your team may not need to be notified until there is a hire. You should offer to let them use the VMS so they can track submittals and interviews etc. Even if the supplier has a different max bill rate, you can create a separate job posting title and rate card for them. Remember that the goal is to manage the spend, not dictate the process. Once they are in the program then you can look at other possibilities. Even if your client says that the supplier is offering more than just hourly rates and maybe they have their own managers who manage the contingent workers, this can also be brought into the program. We have anabled the VMS tool to allow the supplier to turn in Misc Expenses or other invoices in addition to the hourly workers. Or they can agree to bill the management fee separately but at least the hourly workers are being tracked in a tool. It can often make invoiding easier for the managers.|If you do not have SOW in your program then you should offer to bring SOW time and expenses into your program. For example, take a large offshore provider like TCS, Cognizant etc. Many times they bill a combination of hourly workres, fees, deliverables, milestones etc. We have been very successful at talking to the client about just bringing in the T&E workers. The supplier can have their own rate card and their own distribution list so they do NOT need to compete with other suppliers.
